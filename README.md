# kernelscripts
~ Basic scripts to manage kernels ~

This is primarily intended for Gentoo Linux due to paths 
(ccache wrappers, kernel sources) being set to Gentoo
defaults.
You can work around most of this via options and environment
variables though.

For Gentoo these scripts are available in [my overlay](https://github.com/xarblu/xarblu-overlay)
as `sys-kernel/kernelscripts`
